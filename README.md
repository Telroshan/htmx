# Changes in this fork
## Fixes
- Fix outerHTML swap if parent is null (i.e. too fast clicking for example) : an error would be fired trying to access the parent's properties and block further interactions with the element => now ignored when parent is null
- The [`checked`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input/checkbox#checked) attribute is used instead of the [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input/checkbox#value) attribute for checkbox inputs, when building the request payload, which can then correctly be parsed as a boolean by the backend
- Unchecked checkboxes aren't excluded anymore from request payload _(I needed this for PATCH requests for example)_
- Fix target and source elements sent to `selectAndSwap` during the **SSE** swapping process that were inverted in the original code, now allowing to properly use `hx-target` for example to specify which element to swap with SSE
- [SSE swap listeners](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sse/) are now removed from the event sources when the associated element gets removed from the page
- Values passed along a `DELETE` request are encoded as URL parameters _(as for a `GET` request)_ instead of being sent as form data 
- The [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) header is no longer overridden to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` when using [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) method _(htmx would by default override it for any non-GET request on an element that doesn't define the [`hx-encoding`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-encoding/) attribute, but one might want to define this header in their AJAX request using the `context.headers` property)_
- [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) now correctly handles files passed to it through the `context.values` property _(htmx would by default override the content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead of letting [xhr.send](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-send()-method) deduce the multipart/form-data content type itself + it would only use the values of the [`hx-encoding`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-encoding/) and [`enctype`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/enctype), thus ignore the fact that the payload contains file input values and should be treated as `multipart/form-data`)_
## Changes
- The htmx-indicator is not hidden on request's response if the response has a `HX-Redirect` header set (just a personal visual preference)
- If the target specified to [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) (and so the `targetOverride` passed to `issueAjaxRequest()`) can't be found, an error is thrown (instead of the htmx default implementation that crawls the hierarchy to find the first `hx-target` specified on a parent element as a fallback)
- In the default htmx implementation, elements that have an ID have a special treatment during swapping ; if an element with an ID is about to be inserted, and to replace another element with the same ID, for a reason I ignore, htmx clones the old elements "settling attributes" _(that are, by default, `class`, `style`, `width` & `height`)_ into the new element, then restores the new element initial attributes after the settling. My problem with this ; using a [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to apply style to newly added nodes _(for example a line that should be positionned at current local time with a line of JS in a calendar)_ results in those modifications being reverted by htmx after the settling. Since this cloning step appears useless to me (maybe am I wrong though ?), I got rid of it here, as well as the `attributesToSettle` property that was only used for that purpose
- When an htmx error is logged, the `detail` context object passed along in the internal functions is now included in the log, for an easier debugging. This way, a `hx-targetError` for example, will also log the actual target that htmx was trying to retrieve
- The attribute `hx-push-url` is no longer inherited by default by children elements. You can specify `hx-push-url="inherit"` on children elements though, to inherit the value from the closest parent that defines a `hx-push-url`
- htmx's clean up runs in chunks of 4ms of work instead of cleaning up the entire source element's hierarchy in one go. This comes in handy for large hierarchies where htmx could spend hundreds of ms cleaning elements up recursively, freezing the browser's rendering. Remaining work is now postponed to the next animation frame using the layout queues system _(more details below)_ when spending more than 4ms computing
- When using the [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/) attribute set to `"none"`, it's no longer required to have a value defined for the [`hx-target`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/) attribute _(in this case, simply no element will trigger the [htmx:beforeSwap](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:beforeSwap) event, nor being added/removed the [swapping class](https://htmx.org/reference/#classes))_
- Got rid of the htmx [history cache](https://htmx.org/docs/#history) system, since it was causing too many issues with [mutation observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) and event listeners when loading the cached HTML back in the current document. Now just reloads the page if a [htmx-pushed history state](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/) is moved to/from with the browser's navigation actions
- A warning, instead of an error, is fired for bad selectors in [`hx-include`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-include/) and [`hx-indicator`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-indicator/) attributes
## Additions
- `hx-error-target` and `hx-error-swap` attributes to allow swapping server's reponse on error (i.e request with a `status >= 300`). Those attributes behave exactly like, respectively, [hx-target](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/) and [hx-swap](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/)
- `hx-sse-swap` attribute to override `hx-swap` attribute's value for SSE swapping, ie to allow an element to have different swapping behaviours for requests responses & for SSE. Please note that `hx-swap` is used as a fallback in case `hx-sse-swap` is not defined, so this attribute should only be used when necessary, ie to split swapping behaviours apart. 
- The [HX-Trigger](https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger/) header in server's response supports a comma-and-space-separated event names list, to send multiple events to trigger without data, and without having to use a JSON format. Sending for example the header `HX-Trigger: myEvent, myOtherEvent` would trigger both the events `myEvent` and `myOtherEvent` on the client
- The event sources array ([SSE](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sse/)) is now exposed in the htmx API, so client can add eventListeners to the same sources created by htmx with the [hx-sse](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sse/) attribute
- [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) supports an additional property `swap` in the `context` argument, to override the swapping behaviour. This argument must be a string and follows the syntax of the attribute [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/)
- The [`htmx:beforeOnLoad`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:beforeOnLoad), [`htmx:beforeSwap`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:beforeSwap), [`htmx:afterSwap`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterSwap), [`htmx:afterSettle`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterSettle), [`htmx:swapError`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:swapError), [`htmx:afterRequest`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterRequest), [`htmx:afterOnLoad`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterOnLoad), [`htmx:onLoadError`](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:onLoadError) events are now passed an additional property `isError` in the event's `detail` property, which indicates if the request's response has an error status _(ie a code >= 400)_
- The [`hx-target`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/), [`hx-include`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-include/) and [`hx-indicator`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-indicator/) attributes accept 2 new values : `next-sibling` (which targets the [next sibling element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/nextElementSibling)) and `previous-sibling` (which targets the [previous sibling element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/previousElementSibling))
- The htmx API now provides the method `resizeSelect`, which takes a [select HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) as parameter, and resizes it so it fits its selected option
- The htmx API now provides the property `globalParams`, an object in which you can define key-value pairs params to send along every htmx request
## Removals
- Removed the [htmx:beforeProcessNode](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:beforeProcessNode) and [htmx:afterProcessNode](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterProcessNode) events, as it would take 250 ms to fire those when processing 7000 HTML elements _(for reference, that's half the time spent to process those 7000 elements, after optimizations mentioned below)_, and I was absolutely not using them in any of my projects anyway.
## Performance
- The htmx API now provides the methods `readLayout` and `writeLayout`, to execute layout read/write operations while avoiding [layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_layout_thrashing)
- htmx uses `writeLayout` and `readLayout` internally to postpone the elements clean up & settling [to the next animation frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame), so the swap function returns faster _(now takes roughly half the time)_ and the browser can update the DOM _(and the page layout display)_ sooner, providing a better visual experience
- `querySelectorAllExt` checks if the selector is equal to `body`, if so, returns [document.body](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Document/body) instead of calling [document.querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) to retrieve the body. Took down the processing of `from:body` specifiers in 2500 HTML elements, from 2500 ms to 5 ms
- The functions returned by `maybeGenerateConditional` when processing [hx-trigger conditionals](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/) are stored in a cache to avoid [evaluating](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) the generated functions everytime. Took down the processing of `click[!ctrlKey&&!shiftKey&&!altKey]` specifiers in 2500 HTML elements, from 300 ms to 7 ms
